# CT_Course---Space_Shooter

Made as part of assignment for Computer Technology course at FutureGames, class of FG21GP-BOD.
Space Shooter project made in Unity 2021.3.13f1 and DOTS (Entities 0.51.1)

In this project I mainly tried to learn how to use Unitys DOTS functionality and syntax. Meanwhile trying to understand what Data Oriented Programming means.

I have code from a tutorial https://dots-tutorial.moetsi.com/ which I have used for a base and tried to expand and explore DOTS from thereon. Some of the code from the tutorial is still there, while I have created original coded, modified and added functionality as well.

In the project most things work from with entities, such as player controller, spawning, destroying.
