# CT_Course---Space_Shooter

Made as part of assignment for Computer Technology course at FutureGames, class of FG21GP-BOD.
Space Shooter project made in Unity 2021.3.13f1 and DOTS (Entities 0.51.1)

In this project I mainly tried to learn how to use Unitys DOTS functionality and syntax. Meanwhile trying to understand what Data Oriented Programming means.
